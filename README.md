# JWT

- This project was inspired by [web-token/jwt-framework](https://github.com/web-token/jwt-framework) and [brick\math](https://github.com/brick/math).
- It is highly recommended installing the [GMP](http://php.net/manual/en/book.gmp.php) or [BCMath](http://php.net/manual/en/book.bc.php) extension to speed up calculations for PSS signing.
    - GMP nearly 100x faster than BCMath
    - BCMath nearly 500x faster than native
    - Native just works, but should not be used in production.
